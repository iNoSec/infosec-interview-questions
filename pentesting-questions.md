For all interviews one of the rounds included pentesting a web application 
and writing a report to summarize the vulnerabilities found and their impact.
Here is a list of some specific pentesting report content companies asked:


**Pentesting Report 1:**
    Here is web application X , pentest the site for vulnerabilities and write a report.
    For each vulnerability include:
            - Executive Overview (broad explanation of the vulnerability)
            - Vulnerabilities Details (enough information for a developer to understand)
            - Remediation Recommendation (how to fix each vulnerability)
            - Screenshots/video of successful exploits 

    Bonus for finding the following in the web app:
            -Database usernames and passwords
            -Application usernames and passwords
            -Adminâ€™s secret document
            -Contents of /root/garbage
            -Root shell

**Pentesting Report 2:**
    Here is web application X it uses a MYSQL database which has different priviledges levels.
    Find vulnerabilities such as those listed in OWASP TOP 10 and give  some degree of a write-up in a PDF, Word document, Open Document format,
    or text file format. 
    For each vulnerability include:
            - Screenshots/explanations of how you triggered an issue
            - Severity level
            - Impact of the issues discovered (the so what)
            - A recommendation on how to fix each bug ( 1 sentence or so)


**Pentesting Report 3:**
    Share your computer screen with the person who will be interviewing you. 
    You will be playing the role of a security analyst in a triage team. 
    You will be given a web application X, and there is ~8 bug reports for the web 
    application. Read each report, and reproduce each  bug then determine wether 
    the bug report is valid or not. If the bug is not valid give an explanation. 
    Make sure to also give a quick explanation following CVSS to rate the severity 
    of each report. 

    Reports included reproducing bugs such as:
         - Self XSS
         - Manipulating the cookie to get admin privileges 
         - Stored and Reflected XSS
         - Code Execution
